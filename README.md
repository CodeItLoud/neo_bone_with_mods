# neo_bone_with_mods

## Purposes: 
1. Combine the marvelous NEO Bone layout with home row mods to enhance typing flow. 
2. Implement this as a config file for the powerful key remapper Kanata to attain a solution working on windows as well as on macos. 
3. Publish the project at GitHub to allow the download of the Kanata Config file on any PC. 


## Background:
NEO is a family of ergonomic keyboard layouts for the german language. Currently, the home page proposes BONE as their most advanced  layout, although there exist different, even newer layouts which have been added to later.

These ergonomic layouts promise to provide an easy type of flow by concentrating the most-often used letters on keys in the center of the middle and upper row and preventing key combinations which are difficult or slow to tap subsequentially.


## Shortcomings
Modifiers like Shift, Mod3 or Mod4 currently are positioned on the far left or right and partly in different rows, forcing the hands to leave and later come back to their usual typing position, interrupting the flow of typing. This significantly reduces the possible benefit of ergonomic layouts.


## Solution
So-called "home row mods" come to the rescue, providing ordinary keys on home row and upper row with added modifier behaviour, providing an elegant solution for this problem.
